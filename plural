Dear Pluralsight Support,

I have subscribed and paid for a monthly subscription on 2017.12.18

The subscription was marked to be expired today 2018.01.18 on the Subscription & Billing page, and while I have been fully satisfied with your services, I have had no intention to renew it as of now

I have expected the subscription to be inactivated by today; however now I noticed that a new expiration date of 2018.02.19 has been set. So apparently instead of inactivation, the subscription has been extended to another month

As stated above, currently I do not want to continue using the page; neither did I pay for the subscription extension. Can you please advise/help me with this issue

Thank you for your help in advance

Best regards,
