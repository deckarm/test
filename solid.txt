SOLID Principles of Object Oriented Design (Steve Smith)

[The Single Responsibility Principle]

SRP: every obj should have a single resp and that resp should be entirely encaps by the class
Uncle Bob: there should never be more than one reason for a class to change
pl. zsebkes ami mindent tud, csak nem megy bele a zsebembe. just because you can, doesn't mean you should

cohesion: module/class respjei mennyire relatedek es focusedek
coupling: az a degree amivel egy module/class relyol a masik modulon/classon
cel a high cohesion es a loose coupling
